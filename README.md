## Problem

We need UI tools to easily see information about organizations in WT directory. Currently we only have console tools and require a considerable degree of hackerdom.

## Solution

We created tools related to ORG.ID.The ORG.ID explorer let's you:
 * see information about an ORG.ID
 * see how much Lif they have (for trusting purposes)
 * veriy if a message is effectively signed by an organization
 * create a new Organization from a JSON URL.

We also are presenting information from the trust service created by another hack-team.

## We learned

* To work as an ecosystem, integrating with tools from another hack-team
* To access the WT contracts blockchain from different languages, with helpers like wt-js-libs and calling contracts directly with web3
* Smart contracts, abi, etc
* Truffle, metamask, etc
* WT mission: leveling the playfield to let small companies and independent developers (like us!) access the travel industry players
* Travel industry concepts
* Trust problems in decentralized ecosystem
